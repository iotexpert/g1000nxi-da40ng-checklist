# Diamod DA40NG G1000NXI Checklist

This is the electronic checklist for MY G1000NXI DA40NG.  I have added and modified it to suit my needs.  Obviously the only real checklist is your POH.  You should do your own thing and I accept no liability.

I downloaded the original from the Diamond website: https://www.diamondaircraft.com/en/service-and-support/diamond-flight-training/checklists/

The problem is that it has characters that are not in my US delivery characterset.  So I edited it and removed the funky characters.  Probably I should write code to fix that, but that is for another day.

You can edit this checklist using checkset which can be downloaded from Garmins website.  https://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=12031

The G1000NXI behavior is crazy for updating the checklist.  It requires 3 reboots to get it to be loaded.

In order to install the checklist
1. Save it to a sd-card at the top level as "checklist.gcl"
2. Put it in the top mfd slot
3. Turn on the avionics... and wait
4. Turn off the avionics... and wait
3. Turn on the avionics... and wait
